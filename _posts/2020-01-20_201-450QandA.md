For the 201-450 EXAM I found myself learn days and night for my preparation for that exam. In this post I am going to write down for any chapter 50 questions that can be good reference to that EXAM, **please note this reference is not contain the actual questions from that exam**. All the questions you will found here are written by me for help me preparing well the exam.

I encourage you to go through all the questions to be ready for the test, if you have any questions please write them in the comments below, I would be very happy for your response if this post was helpful to you. I wrote a script in JavaScript so you can see your score at the end of the exam.

#LPIC2 201-450 Q&A

1. What will happen if SWAP space used extensively?
a.  The root filesystem become full and because of that it canâ€™t be used any more
b. Because the SWAP is memory that read from the disk, the user may feel the slowness of his system, the performance will be poor for any other program because the loading of hard disk.
c. The RAM will take in place and will be use as the SWAP will load fully.
d. An error will popup on the screan and inform the user that there is no free memory that can be use for the system.

Answer: b

Explain: The SWAP is file that use as memory from the disk, when the memory is over loaded the SWAP will be used, because of that the hard disk became used heavily and the user may feel that system is slowdown. Normally the SWAP always being as 0 used, if we will see that on our system the SWAP being used even we have plenty free RAM this is not normal.

In my case I am using Ubuntu and I found that I have SWAP used even the memory not being use fully:

To improve the performance we need to set the swappiness on our system. The swappiness parameter controls the tendency of the kernel to move processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk.
We can find the swappiness value on the `/proc/sys/vm/swappiness` and also we can set it up using the following command:
```
sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
```
To make a change permanent, edit the configuration file with your favorite editor:
```
vim gedit /etc/sysctl.conf
```
If that solution is work well for you great, if it doesn't you may want to restart the SWAP by running:
```
swapoff -a
swapon -a
```

I also found some script that can do that for you, this script done just that carefully, because if you don't have enough free RAM to hold everything in RAM plus everything in swap, trying to disable swap will cause your system to become unresponsive. Just remember to run **sync** before you running that script and save every file you have open.
```
#!/bin/bash

# Make sure that all text is parsed in the same language
export LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8

export LANGUAGE=en_US:en
export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8

# Calculate how much memory and swap is free
free_data="$(free)"
mem_data="$(echo "$free_data" | grep 'Mem:')"
free_mem="$(echo "$mem_data" | awk '{print $4}')"
buffers="$(echo "$mem_data" | awk '{print $6}')"
cache="$(echo "$mem_data" | awk '{print $7}')"
total_free=$((free_mem + buffers + cache))
used_swap="$(echo "$free_data" | grep 'Swap:' | awk '{print $3}')"

echo -e "Free memory:\t$total_free kB ($((total_free / 1024)) MB)\nUsed swap:\t$used_swap kB ($((used_swap / 1024)) MB)"

# Do the work
if [[ $used_swap -eq 0 ]]; then
    echo "Congratulations! No swap is in use."
elif [[ $used_swap -lt $total_free ]]; then
    echo "Freeing swap..."
    swapoff -a
    swapon -a
else
    echo "Not enough free memory. Exiting."
    exit 1
fi
```

2. You run the `vmstat` command, which columns stand for Time spent idle and Time spent waiting for IO as percentages of total CPU time?
